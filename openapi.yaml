  title: Universal OID4VP
  version: 0.1.0
  description: |
    This universal API enables standardized integration with OID4VP-capable Relying Party agents. 
    It minimizes custom integration efforts by defining a baseline for software interoperability. 
    Due to privacy concerns, it favors POST methods with payloads instead of query/path parameters 
    to reduce log-leakage of sensitive values like query IDs or correlation identifiers.

      summary: Create authorization request and session
      description: |
        Creates a new OID4VP Authorization Request that can be used to request Digital Credentials from a wallet.
        Returns URIs needed to initiate the auth flow and check its status. The queryId passed in needs to be known to the agent. This endpoint is protected using OAuth2/OIDC normally with a confidential client.  Do not call from the frontend!

        Checks the current status of an Authorization Request session. Can optionally include verified credential data

Although the correlationId should be the only one strictly necesary we require both the queryId and correlationId, to keep the create response and auth request symmetrical and to not assume global sessions accross different queryIds in RP implementations.

      description: >
        As soon as you include this object the OID4VP agent has to generate a QR code. Every RP implementation needs to support this, as we want to make it easy on the integration side. The integration side can choose whether they create their own QR codes, or whether they want to use the QR code from the RP. Thus every RP conforming to this spec should support generating a QR code in data-uri format. No property is mandatory, so a "qrCodeOpts": {} is already valid and generates a QR with the default properties applied. A RP implementation is free to implement additional properties like logo's etc. This API only mandates a few common properties to not make it too complex for RPs. If the integrating app wants to use their own QR codes they simply need to omit the qr_code param from the request. The agent should not generate a QT code in this case
